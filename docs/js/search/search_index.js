The good issues for newcomers are marked with good-first-issue.\nWorking together in an open and welcoming environment is the foundation of our\nsuccess, so please respect our Code of Conduct.\nGuidelines\nWorkflow\nWe use the Feature Branch Workflow\nand review all changes we merge to master.\nAutomated builds, tests, security and code quality checks\nThe code is required to pass the automated build, all unit-tests must be green and the configured security- (snyk) and code quality (lgtm) checks\nmust be OK before the pull request can be merged.\nCommit Message\nCommit messages shall follow the conventions defined by conventional-changelog.\nCode Style\nPlease follow the typescript code style which is established in tslint.json. (Works out of the box in many editors, e.g. Visual Studio Code)\nSetting up the local development environment\nYou will need to have administrative access to an Alteryx Server to setup the development environment.\nIf you don't have a local server installed, you can register here for a trial license. (that is free as in a beer :)\nLocal Development Scripts\nDeveloping new features and unit tests npm run dev\nThe npm run dev command will start the typescript transpiler and mocha unit testing in a watch mode so that you can add new features to the library.\nDon't forget to start another shell with npm run ts:watch which runs the typescript transpiler.\npackage.json scripts\nnpm run clean\nDeletes dist/ directory.\nnpm run clean:dist\nDeletes dist/ directory.\nnpm run prepare\nPrepares the library for installation. It is called by npm pack and npm install commands.\nThe script executes following steps:\n\ncleans the dist/ directory (npm run clean)\ntranspiles the typescript code to dist/ directory (npm run ts:build)\n\nnpm run test\nTranspiles the typescript and runs the full mocha unit test suite. (this only works on normal developer tenants)\nnpm run sanity\nTranspiles the typescript and runs the mocha unit tests marked with @sanity (this only works on normal developer tenants)\nnpm run test-dev\nTranspiles the typescript and runs the mocha unit test suite with NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 so that you can inspect the HTTP traffic e.g. by using Telerik Fiddler as a proxy server.\nnpm run test-jenkins\nCalled by jenkins to create test resports in CI/CD pipeline.\nnpm run ts:build\nRun the typescript transpiler.\nnpm run ts:build:dist\nRun the typescript transpiler and save results in dist/ folder. (used by prepare script)\nnpm run ts:watch\nRun typescript transpiler in watch mode (used for development)\nnpm run lint\nStart typescript linter\nnpm run dev\nLocal development for new features. Runs concurrently typescript transpiler in watch mode (npm run ts:watch) and mocha in watch mode (npm run test:watch)\nnpm run doc\nGenerates the documentation.\nnpm run createkey\nCreates a private RSA_3072 key with help of openssl library (which must be available in your PATH)\nnpm run license\nChecks if all depenedent libraries are in a set of allowed libraries. Used by jenkins CI/CD pipeline.\nnpm run license:summary\nPrints out a license summary for the whole dependency tree.\nnpm run pkg\nCreates the binary files with the CLI for Windows, Linux and

APIs. It is compatible with linux, windows and MacOS.It supports both frontend (browser e.g. angular, react...) and backend development in node.js.\nQuick Links\n\n\n\nwhat\nwhere\n\n\n\n\ndocumentation\ncoming soon\n\n\ngenerated api-doc\njupiterbak.github.io/ayx-node\n\n\nnpm package\n@jupiterbak/ayx-node\n\n\nsource\nhttps://github.com/jupiterbak/ayx-node\n\n\nchangelog\nCHANGELOG.md\n\n\ncontributing\nCONTRIBUTING.md\n\n\nlicense\nLICENSE.md\n\n\n\nInstallation\nThe recommended way to get started using the nodejs is by using the npm (Node Package Manager) to install the dependency in your project.\nAfter you've created your own project using npm init, you can run:\nnpm install @jupiterbak/ayx-node --save\n# or ...\nyarn add @jupiterbak/ayx-node --saveThis will download the this library and add a dependency entry in your package.json file.\nIf you are a Typescript user, you will need the Node.js type definitions:\nnpm install -D @types/nodeQuick Start\nThis guide will show you how to set up a simple application using Node.js that allows you to interact with an Alteryx server.
